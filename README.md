My name is Jay!  I am a recent graduate of Towson University pursuing a career in Data Analytics!  I have a degree in Computer Science with a track in Cyber Security, but I also have a Data Analytics Certificate through Google and a Business Analytics Certificate through Johns Hopkins!  My dream job would be one in Investment Banking; I have a passion for the stock market and even wrote my own Algorithmic Trading Bot in python!  Below are some of my other interests!
